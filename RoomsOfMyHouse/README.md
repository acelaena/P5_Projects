## Rooms of my House
#### by Alina Xia


### Overview
A simple project using a map-like data structure to navigate through nodes, or rooms, of a house. Each node represents one state of the state machine. 

### Notes
- Rooms.js is the main data structure used in this project. 
- Kitchen image source: https://www.extraspace.com/blog/home-organization/room-organization/design-a-minimalist-kitchen-with-these-ideas/
- Bathroom image source: http://www.home-designing.com/modern-minimalist-bathroom-interior-design-decor-photos
- office image source: https://www.spacejoy.com/interior-designs-blog/7-home-office-setups-to-get-you-inspired

- I (very obviously) burnt out along doing the background artwork, and later backgrounds became more of photo edits rather than photo paintovers. 
- Mug design by LookHUMAN
- All other uncredited art by me
