## Self Portrait in P5.js
#### by acelaena

### Overview
A self portrait using a pixel grid created in p5.js


### Technical Details
Uses the Pixel JS classes I wrote. In technicality, using classes is a much more roundabout way to express a grid of colored squares, because it could be done using a simple 2d array, but using a 2d array requires each pixel to be redrawn when changed, and is much less readable to the human eye. 

also, 160% cpu usage reduced to 14%. Nice.
