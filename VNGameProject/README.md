## Project 2 - Social Justice Visual Novel
#### by Alina Xia


### Overview
A visual novel-type game in which you follow the story of Wendy (WendyWonderly), a comic artist, who's struggling to tell the story he/she/they want to tell because of online social justice marauders harrassing them. The events in this game are based on real events and anectdotes I've experienced or witnessed.


### Technical Details


### Notes
I haven't yet gotten far on coding because I want to fully flesh out my story and comic script before I get coding, so I know exactly what I need and don't build more or less that that. Coding is comparatively easy/less time consuming than writing since writing is not one of my strong suits and if I don't have stuff set in stone I'm very prone to massively overhauling things as I'm working on it (aka wasting time)
